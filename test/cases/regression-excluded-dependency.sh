# This test case verifies that a blueprint can include a package which has a
# dependency that is listed among "excluded" for a certain image type and
# osbuild-composer doesn't fail to depsolve this blueprint.
#
# The script currently works only for RHEL and CentOS which provide
# "nss-devel" package and exclude "nss" package in the image type
# definition. The testing contains the "nss-devel" package which can only
# be installed if the "nss" package isn't excluded
