CI will not be ran automatically if WIP label is applied or the PR is in DRAFT state, instead only
a link will be provided to the pipeline which can then be triggered manually if desired. To run the
CI automatically either switch the PR to ready or apply WIP+test label.

Outside contributors need manual approval from one of the osbuild-composer maintainers.

Schutzbot will only be triggered if all Tests jobs in GitHub workflow succeed.
