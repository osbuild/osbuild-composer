// Package jobqueue provides a generic interface to a simple job queue.
//
// Jobs are pushed to the queue with Enqueue(). Workers call Dequeue() to
// receive a job and FinishJob() to report one as finished.
//
// Each job has a type and arguments corresponding to this type. These are
// opaque to the job queue, but it mandates that the arguments must be
// serializable to JSON. Similarly, a job's result has opaque result arguments
// that are determined by its type.
//
// A job can have dependencies. It is not run until all its dependencies have
// finished.
