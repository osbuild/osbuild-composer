Binaries
========

osbuild-composer: The main binary, the service that maintains the queue and schedules all
jobs. This is started as the main process by systemd or container runtime.

osbuild-worker: The worker binary that handles jobs from the job queue locally.

osbuild-worker-executor: The binary that runs osbuild to build an image on an isolated VM.

osbuild-koji: Submits builds to Koji.

osbuild-jobsite-*: Provides an isolated set of services to run builds in. They can be separated
from the rest of the system through network segmentation or other means. The jobsite and what's
in it are only available to things inside it.
