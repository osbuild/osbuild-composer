#
# Maintenance Helpers
#
# This makefile contains targets used for development, as well as helpers to
# aid automatization of maintenance. Unless a target is documented in
# `make help`, it is not supported and is only meant to be used by developers
# to aid their daily development work.
#
# All supported targets honor the `SRCDIR` variable to find the source-tree.
# For most unsupported targets, you are expected to have the source-tree as
# your working directory. To specify a different source-tree, simply override
# the variable via `SRCDIR=<path>` on the commandline. By default, the working
# directory is used for build output, but `BUILDDIR=<path>` allows overriding
# it.
#

#
# Automatic Variables
#
# This section contains a bunch of automatic variables used all over the place.
# They mostly try to fetch information from the repository sources to avoid
# hard-coding them in this makefile.
#
# Most of the variables here are pre-fetched so they will only ever be
# evaluated once. This, however, means they are always executed regardless of
# which target is run.
#
#     VERSION:
#         This evaluates the `Version` field of the specfile. Therefore, it will
#         be set to the latest version number of this repository without any
#         prefix (just a plain number).
#
#     COMMIT:
#         This evaluates to the latest git commit sha. This will not work if
#         the source is not a git checkout. Hence, this variable is not
#         pre-fetched but evaluated at time of use.
#

VERSION := $(shell (cd "$(SRCDIR)" && grep "^Version:" osbuild-composer.spec | sed 's/[^[:digit:]]*\([[:digit:]]\+\).*/\1/'))
COMMIT = $(shell (cd "$(SRCDIR)" && git rev-parse HEAD))

#
# Generic Targets
#
# The following is a set of generic targets used across the makefile. The
# following targets are defined:
#
#     help
#         This target prints all supported targets. It is meant as
#         documentation of targets we support and might use outside of this
#         repository.
#         This is also the default target.
#
#     $(BUILDDIR)/
#     $(BUILDDIR)/%/
#         This target simply creates the specified directory. It is limited to
#         the build-dir as a safety measure. Note that this requires you to use
#         a trailing slash after the directory to not mix it up with regular
#         files. Lastly, you mostly want this as order-only dependency, since
#         timestamps on directories do not affect their content.

# Building packages
#
# The following rules build osbuild-composer packages from the current HEAD
# commit, based on the spec file in this directory.  The resulting packages
# have the commit hash in their version, so that they don't get overwritten
# when calling `make rpm` again after switching to another branch.
#
# All resulting files (spec files, source rpms, rpms) are written into
# ./rpmbuild, using rpmbuild's usual directory structure.
