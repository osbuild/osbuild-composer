# Release Notes

This directory contains release notes for _osbuild-composer_ in the form of
short markdown documents, sorted into subdirectories by release.

When proposing a user-visible change, please add a release note into the
`unreleased` directory. The note should explain the change from the perspective
of somebody using _osbuild-composer_ and ideally how the change affects them or
how they can make use of new functionality.

When preparing a release, a maintainer will rename the `unreleased` directory
and summarize its contents in `NEWS.md`.
