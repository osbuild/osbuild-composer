# Add support for `org.osbuild.rhsm` osbuild stage

Add support for `org.osbuild.rhsm` osbuild stage. This stage is available in
osbuild since version 24. The stage currently allows only configuring the
enablement status of two RHSM DNF plugins, specifically of `product-id` and
`subscription-manager` DNF plugins.
