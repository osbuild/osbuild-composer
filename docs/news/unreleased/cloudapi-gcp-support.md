# Cloud API: Add support for Google Cloud Platform target

Added support in Cloud API to upload images to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and
share them with specified accounts. There is currently no GCP-specific image
type, since GCP supports importing VHD and VMDK image types already supported by
the `osbuild-composer`.
