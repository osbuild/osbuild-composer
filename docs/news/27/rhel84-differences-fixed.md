and disabled services. To remedy these differences the following changes have 
been made:

oddjob-mkhomedir, psmisc, authselect-compat, dbxtool.

The following packages have been removed from our qcow2 image: 
dnf-plugin-spacewalk, fwupd, nss, and udisks2.

The following services have been enabled: nfs-convert.service.

The following services have been removed/disabled: mdmonitor.service, 
udisks2.service, fwupd-refresh.timer, mdcheck_continue.timer, 
mdcheck_start.timer, and mdmonitor-oneshot.timer.
